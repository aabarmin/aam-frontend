# Subscription management

* It seems, validation is now always working, error message is not displayed.

# Mail

* Ideally would be nice to add some exception handling around sending mails but maybe next time. 

# Common

* Would be better to use Google Style as it is better.
* There are unnecessary `<div />` tags everywhere, should be removed.
